## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a [monero light wallet client library](https://github.com/woodser/monero-cpp/pull/73) which I believe could significantly improve the user experience of monero wallets. This would enable the development of wallet applications with instant sync time, addressing one of the major UX challenges of monero. To achieve this, I am actively contributing to the [monero-cpp](https://github.com/woodser/monero-cpp) project, which serves as the foundation for this library.
- ðŸŒ± I am currently studying Computer Engineering at the University of Pisa, I work as a GIS software developer for an important company of the Almawave group, and of course I am learning monero!
