## About Me ðŸ‘½

- ðŸŒ± I am currently studying Computer Engineering at the University of Pisa, I work as a GIS software developer for an important company of the [Almawave Group](https://www.almawave.com/), and of course I am learning monero!

- ðŸ“Œ I have contributed to
  - [haveno-ts](https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno-ts/commits?author=everoddandeven), a TypeScript library for using Haveno.
  - [monero-java](https://github.com/woodser/monero-java), a Java library for using Monero

- :bowtie: Lead mantainer of
  - [monerod-gui](https://github.com/everoddandeven/monerod-gui), a Monero Node Manager for Windows, Linux and MacOS.
  - [monero-ecwid](https://github.com/everoddandeven/monero-ecwid), a Monero Payment Gateway for ECWID Stores.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the [`monero_wallet_light.h`](https://github.com/woodser/monero-cpp/pull/73), a new [`monero_wallet.h`](https://github.com/woodser/monero-cpp-library/blob/master/src/wallet/monero_wallet.h) implementation which shares the view key with a 3rd party or self-hosted [light wallet server](https://github.com/vtnerd/monero-lws) in order to scan the blockchain for incoming transfers. I believe it could significantly improve the user experience of monero wallets and would enable the development of wallet applications with instant sync time, addressing one of the major UX challenges of monero. To achieve this, I am actively contributing to the [monero-cpp](https://github.com/woodser/monero-cpp) project.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any monero project!

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about [QGIS](https://qgis.org/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/), [GeoTools](https://geotools.org/), [Angular](https://angular.dev/), [Monero LWS](https://github.com/vtnerd/monero-lws), [Monero Light Wallet](https://github.com/woodser/monero-cpp/pull/73)
